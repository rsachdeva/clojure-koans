# Clojure Koans - with logging integrated

The Clojure Koans are a fun and easy way to get started with Clojure - no
experience assumed or required.  Just follow the instructions below to start
making tests pass!


### Getting Started

Please see read me at https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans

This also includes integration with simple log4j so logging can also be used as necessary
to gain better understanding of the code.
