Clojure Koans are at-
https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans

Here the solutions are there with helpful comments in between if needed (koans build up is mostly self explanatory), and
Logging integrated for real world debugging and understanding :)

In the end, you get the lovely message:


You have achieved clojure enlightenment. Namaste.
